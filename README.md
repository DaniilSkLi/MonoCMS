# MonoCMS
My exprerimental project.

I am currently working on a new core and visual design. In the new kernel, I will improve the old features, merge some, and throw some overboard. I have already greatly improved the work with the database. Soon I will be able to provide a fairly working CMS and will use it myself in projects. So far I am using only the old kernel, because many things become much easier, and when I finish the new kernel, it will be even easier.
