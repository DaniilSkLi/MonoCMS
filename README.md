# MonoCMS
My exprerimental project.

There will be possibly non-working versions in the "Develop" branch, this version is highly undesirable for any use (it is intended for developers). If you want to use "MonoCMS" - use the "Release" branch, or at least the "Beta" branch. The "Alpha" branch is also not desirable for use, it is intended for those who want to try the latest version.
